This folder contains a selection of files from MOP (http://www.stochastik.
math.uni-goettingen.de/mop), and a class definition by me. If a computer is 
MAC or Windows PC, then the complied mex files may probably work without 
re-compiling. Otherwise, one has to run first
    mex -Dchar16_t=UINT16_T mrcoefCube_mex.c
    mex -Dchar16_t=UINT16_T mrdualCube_mex.c
